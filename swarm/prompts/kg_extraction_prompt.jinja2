**Instructions**:

1. **Identify Entities**:
   - Extract all relevant entities, such as products, applications, compliance categories, and any other significant terms.
   - List each identified entity along with its type (e.g., Product, Application, Compliance Category).

2. **Identify Rules**:
   - Extract any rules or conditions associated with the entities, including compliance requirements, security criteria, or specific attributes.
   - For each rule, specify the entity it applies to and summarize the rule as clearly as possible.

3. **Identify Relationships**:
   - Identify relationships between entities based on extracted rules or implied connections.
   - For each relationship, provide the following structure:
     - **Subject**: The primary entity (e.g., "Application A").
     - **Predicate**: The type of relationship (e.g., "is non-compliant with", "requires", "is a category of").
     - **Object**: The secondary entity or attribute (e.g., "Compliance Category").
     - **Properties**: Any additional details relevant to the relationship (e.g., "contractual obligation", "frequency", "accountability").

**Output Format** (Use **only** the following structure, with empty lists `[]` if there are no results):

- **Entities**: [{"name": "EntityName", "type": "EntityType"}, ...]
- **Rules**: [{"entity": "EntityName", "rule": "RuleDescription"}, ...]
- **Relationships**: [{"subject": "EntityName", "predicate": "RelationshipType", "object": "RelatedEntity", "properties": {"key": "value", ...}}, ...]

**Example Output**:
- **Entities**: [{"name": "Application A", "type": "Application"}, {"name": "Compliance Category", "type": "Category"}]
- **Rules**: [{"entity": "Application A", "rule": "must adhere to Compliance Category"}]
- **Relationships**: [{"subject": "Application A", "predicate": "is non-compliant with", "object": "Compliance Category", "properties": {"contractual obligation": "yes", "frequency": "quarterly"}}]
